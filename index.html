                        But that’s probably not what will immediately kick off a new wave of users. Audioboo plans to officially launch this with a number of high profile media partners “in a couple of weeks” including the BBC, ABC Australia, Guardian, Aljazeera, Sky News and more all trialling the beta versions of the new platform that works with the plugin. A revamp of the Android version of the app will bring it up to par with the iPhone and have a similar plugin environment.

                                OundCloud recently entered into the spoken word space, technically the “patch” of Audioboo. Audioboo was technically the first in 2009 to make voice “social” but it’s been joined by others like Broadcastr, Cinch and also iPadio, though iPadio is more enterprise focused. However, Soundcloud’s music focus has given it an impressive range of features in manipulating sound, while Audioboo has concentrated on dealing with broadcasters and media martners.s “in a couple of weeks” including the BBC, ABC Australia, Guardian, Aljazeera, Sky News and more all trialling the beta versions of the new platform that works with the plugin.
